# MATLAB-based Projects (DSP LAB) Practices

This repository contains MATLAB-based projects and simulations developed to understand and apply concepts in Digital Signal Processing. These projects were completed as part of academic coursework using MATLAB to model, analyze, and visualize DSP techniques such as filtering, convolution, DFT, and signal reconstruction.
